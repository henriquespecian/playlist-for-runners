# React Frontend for Node.js Backend

This project is a React frontend application designed to consume a Node.js backend. Below are the details regarding the project structure, setup instructions, and usage.

## Project Structure

```
frontend
├── public
│   └── index.html          # Main HTML file for the React application
├── src
│   ├── App.jsx             # Main component of the React application
│   ├── index.jsx           # Entry point for the React application
│   ├── components
│   │   └── ExampleComponent.jsx  # Example functional component
│   └── services
│       └── api.js          # API service for backend communication
├── package.json             # npm configuration file
└── README.md                # Project documentation
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**
   To start the React application, run:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Usage

- The application is structured to allow easy integration with the Node.js backend.
- You can add new components in the `src/components` directory.
- API calls to the backend should be handled in the `src/services/api.js` file.
